# PermOps

### Permaculture & Tech Infrastructure
<!-- Introduction  -->
---
## Agenda
1. What *are* these practices?
2. What are the commonalities?
4. Resources

---
## What are you talking about?
* Tech Infrastructure
* Permaculture

---
## Site Reliability Engineering
* An evolution of 'sysadmin' or 'devops' positions
* Design and implement computing infrastrucutre, with an eye towards fault tolerance and minimizing human intervention for routine work.  
* Increased focus on programming and automating with code

---
## Permaculture
* Originally a portmanteau of 'Permanent Agriculture', but later retconned to 'Permanent Culture' to highlight the importance of human systems
* Invented by Bill Mollison and Geoff Lawton, a pair of ecologists from Austrailia

---
## Discovering Permaculture
* Answer to the frustration of the 2016 political cycle
* Pushed myself  After the 2016 election, I felt that I wanted to push myself to create a constructive and positive vision for the future
* Started volunteering more, and eventually stumbled upon the Permaculture community online
* The more I looked into it, the more I liked 

---
## What did I like?
* Systems Thinking
* Humility before complexity
* The belief that complexity is tractable
* Value action, but not for its own sake
* Culture of learning and vanguardism. 
<!-- * When you value good design and decreasing toil, that pushes you to collaborate with others, and that encourages yourself and others to push the state of the art forward.  -->

## Permaculture is a Framework
* The ideas are rarely novel
  * the innovation is binding them all together and applying them to particular categories of problems
* What I'm doing here is weakening the limits of theframework slightly to apply the framework to another domain.

Table of Contents
0. Introduce and show video
1. Review the 3 principles
2. Review a *selection* of the 13 values
3. Describe example Permaculture implementations
4. [STRETCH] Touch on Permaculture and FP, Category Theory, and the Actor Model

## Ethical Guidelines
* Meant to limit and guide crude self-interest
* Earth Care
  * Increase
  * SRE work has a much more confined definition of 'world', but the role is sitll to engage in high leverage & well-designed activities
* People care
  * If
* Fair Share
  * Sharing the load on the tream
* Future Care
  * plan for the good of the next several generations 
    * new coders, future forms of the companies, future users of OSS

## 13 Design Principles
* Apply self-regulation and accept feedback
  * If something goes wrong, change it

* Produce little to no waste
  * i.e. avoid creating systems 
  * Things like Hackweeks or "20% time" are rarely wastes of time
  * reduce unused capacity

* Integrate rather than segregate
  * one codebase, manage most of our applications on a single cluster with a single interface
  * Our tools are nearly always integrations of several others
  * Sharing ideas

* Catch and store energy
  * I believe you see this a lot with healthy engineering culture. There's a lot of energy to be found in group curiousity, and direre to learn

## Favorite terms and concepts
* Swale
* Hugelkultur
* Vietnamese Double Vault -- toilet

---
## Important differences
* Iteration cycle is a lot longer when dealing with the natural world
* We have analytical and construction tools available to us that enable consistent high-leverage activities

<!-- Conclusion  -->
---
## Areas of Investigation
* Formalizing these thoughts a bit more, in a well sourced manner
* Seeing how the Functional Programming paradigm applies to this case. Likewise, Category Theory. 
* Expanding on the idea of "Permanent Operations" -- how long-running and fault tolerant can we make our systems, and what are the tools and absractions that will get us there
  * What is a reasonable goal? When do you see diminishing returns?
* See how else this could be applied to our situation with it feeling like too much of a stretch.

---
## Closing
* Enduring and resilient infrastructure will be the product of a team and community designed to endure. These means takiing care of the team, the the communities it's a member of, the broader comapny. 

If we want to create a resilient infrastructure, tthen it must exist on a team where the practices are
