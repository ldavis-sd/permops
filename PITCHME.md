### Permaculture & Tech Infrastructure
<!-- Introduction  -->
---
## Agenda
1. What *are* these practices?
2. How can Permaculture guide Tech Infrastructure Management?
3. Resources

---
## What are you talking about?
* Tech Infrastructure
* Permaculture

---
## Tech Infrastructure
* For me, it's everything between developer workstations and
* SREs design and implement computing infrastrucutre, 
  * prioritize fault tolerance and minimize human intervention

---
## Permaculture
* Permanent + Culture
* Invented by Bill Mollison and Geoff Lawton, a pair of ecologists from Austrailia

---
## Discovering Permaculture
* Answer to the frustration of the 2016 political cycle
* I wanted to push myself to create a constructive and positive vision for the future
* Eventually stumbled upon the Permaculture community online

---
## What did I like?
* Fosters Systems Thinking
* Humility before complexity
* The belief that complexity is tractable
* Value action, but not for its own sake
* Culture of learning and vanguardism
<!-- * When you value good design and decreasing toil, that pushes you to collaborate with others, and that encourages yourself and others to push the state of the art forward.  -->

---
## Permaculture is a Framework
* The ideas are rarely novel
  * the innovation is binding them all together and applying them to particular categories of problems
* What I'm doing here is weakening the limits of theframework slightly to apply the framework to another domain.

Table of Contents
0. Introduce and show video
1. Review the 3 principles
2. Review a *selection* of the 13 values
3. Describe example Permaculture implementations
4. [STRETCH] Touch on Permaculture and FP, Category Theory, and the Actor Model

X. Throughout all of these, make allusions back to their relevance to tech infrastructure management

## Ethical Guidelines
* Meant to limit and guide crude self-interest
1.  Earth Care
  <!-- * Increase
  * SRE work has a much more confined definition of 'world', but the role is sitll to engage in high leverage & well-designed activities -->
2.  People care
3. Fair Share
  <!-- * Sharing the load on the tream -->
4.  Future Care
  <!-- * plan for the good of the next several generations 
    * new coders, future forms of the companies, future users of OSS -->

---
## 13 Design Principles
* Apply self-regulation and accept feedback
  <!-- * If something goes wrong, change it -->

* Produce little to no waste
  <!-- * i.e. avoid creating systems 
  * Things like Hackweeks or "20% time" are rarely wastes of time
  * reduce unused capacity
  * use efficient abstractions -->

* Integrate rather than segregate
  <!-- * one codebase, manage most of our applications on a single cluster with a single interface
  * Our tools are nearly always integrations of several others
  * Sharing ideas -->

* Catch and store energy
  <!-- * I believe you see this a lot with healthy engineering culture. There's a lot of energy to be found in group curiousity, and direre to learn  -->

## Favorite terms and concepts
* Zones
* Swales
* Hugelkultur
* Humanure Vietnamese Double Vault -- toilet
* Invisible vs Visible Infrastructure

<!-- Conclusion  -->
---
## Further Investigation
* Formalizing these thoughts a bit more
* Have fun applying Category Theory (or trying to) to site analyses. S 
* Expanding on the idea of "Permanent Operations"
  * Wow long-running and fault tolerant can we make our systems, and what are the tools and absractions that will get us there
  * What is a reasonable goal? When do you see diminishing returns?

## Closing
Creating Enduring and resilient infrastructure will be the product of a team and community designed to endure. These means takiing care of the team, the the communities it's a member of, the broader comapny. 

If we want to create a resilient infrastructure, tthen it must exist on a team where the practices are
