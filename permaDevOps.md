## What is Permaculture?
* 'Permaculture' refers to a set of sustainable design principles, originally and typically applied to agricultural and social systems, but can be applied elsewhere. 

## How did I get into it?
After the 2016 election I felt that I needed to push myself to start thinking constructively, to push myself to build a positive and constructive vision of the world.


## Design Principles and Philosophies
* Energy In & Energy Out. 
    * Here 'sustainable' refers to not consuming more energy/resources than you're contributing
    * Here 'regenerative' means producing more resources than you're consuming. [Yes, conservation of energy and mass still applies! Give an example]

* It's far better to obsess over a design and do that correctly than c

* Zones
    * When evaluating a design
    * In a farm, a "zone 1" would be your home, or the kitchen, where you spend a good deal of your time. Among other things, you would want to make your life in this zone as easy as possible
    * Applied to tech, you might want to consider where engineers spend a lot of their time (IDE, command line, kubectl), or the 

    A good example of a higher-ordinal zone would be something like a low maintenance fruit orchard at the edge of your farm. It provides utility, but you're not there often and is relatively low on the totem when it comes to expending energy. 

    A good example of this in DevOps comes from a conversation Dave and I had yesterday had about Prometheus, our monitoring system. This comes in two parts: P8s is critical to how we manage our infrastructure and applications, so it's use could be considered Zone 1. However, while troubleshooting P8s we had to tear down and redeploy it. We identified improvements that could be made to that process, but also realized that this is something that has happened once in the past year in the half. If we 

    Those improvements are now on our to-do list, but when you consider all of the different things I could be working on, it's a low-leverage activity. 

    NB: Entropy is real! If you leave your Zone 3s, and 4s unmaintained chaos will try to reclaim them! This can either be the forest abutting your homestead starting to encroach on your land, or once-reliable code no longer functioning as intended. This is not an excuse for neglect!

* The Idea of 'high leverage activities'. This is phrased in another way within the community, but I found how it was described in Edmond Lau's "The Effective Engineer" was best. You want to be spending your

## Applied to DevOps

## Applied to myself
* A healthy mix of (1) humility before complex problems and (2) realizing that most problems ARE surmountable. 
* Being more mindful of how I spend my time -- When I consider how I'm spending my time, am I winding up generating more 'energy and order' for myself, or does it feel like I'm frittering it away to not a whole lot of benefit?

Alignment of Goals
As an Site Reliability Engineer, my goal should be to design and implement systems that take care of themselves, that prioritize smart design over toil, and minimizes the amount of human intervention required to keep things running smoothly. 


## Important quotes from my notes

* "Design beyond your borders. Design beyond your generation
* EROEI: Energy Return on Energy Invested
* We need to be design intensive, NOT labor intensive
* The problem you're facing can be a solution to something else
    * see: duck poop
* P.A.T.O: Protracted and Thoughtful Observation
* You won't always be around -- plan your legacy. 
  * During community organizing training, I heard this concept described as 'Deep Self-Interest'. 
* Planning for peak events
  * drought, traffic spike, loss of an entire data center
* Plan for your bio-region
  * Your problems and the resources at hand to solve them a re very different from someone in the rainforest or Central Asian steppe.
* form guilds and collaborate with those doing similar work as you

* Invisible structures
  * physical building, but also the social relations
  * 



* Refuse to participate in the lies we've been told
* Scale of permanece
    * spectrum from 'easy to change' through 'difficult or impossible to change'
        * ex: The number of ducks you keep vs the regional climate
        * ex: Changing a background color vs 'how you authenticate users on your platform'
* Permaculture Trinity
    1. Earth Care
        * increase positive impact
        * Go beyond sustainable
    2. People Care
        * caring for your self and local communities
        * equitable distribution of resources
    3. Fair Share
        * Mutually beneficial relationships (e.g. contributing to open source)
    4. Future Care
        * plan for the good of the next several generations 
            * e.g. your future self, future engineers, and even the company several years from now

* Permaculture Principles
  * There are 13, but only select the ones that are hyper relevant
